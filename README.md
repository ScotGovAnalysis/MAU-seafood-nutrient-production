# MAU - Seafood nutrient mapping

This repository contains the code and methodology used to match seafood species to (estimated) nutrient contents. This is used internally within the Scottish Government to estimate the total volume of macro- and micronutrients produced from Scottish seafood production by mapping these nutrient content estimates to production volume figures.

For the purposes of this public repository, only the nutrient content assumptions (by species) are included as data files - not the detailed production data files used internally. The nutrient content assumptions could however be used in conjunction with published production data such as the [Scottish sea fisheries statistics](https://www.gov.scot/collections/sea-fisheries-statistics/), the [Scottish fish farm production survey](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-fish-farm-production-surveys/), or the [Scottish shellfish farm production survey](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-shellfish-farm-production-surveys/) (all published by Scottish Government). Fisheries production data for the UK as a whole can be found on the [Marine Management Organisation's website](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-sea-fisheries-annual-statistics).

The methodology and code is published to facilitate feedback from the public and enable collaboration with researchers at one of our Main Research Providers - or beyond.
